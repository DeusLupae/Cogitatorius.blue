        <h1>All About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Cooper Blakley. My Latin name is Mars Cogitatorius Animi Latinus, Deus Lupae. I study Spanish (Spanish 3) and Latin (Latin 1). I consider myself to be a Linguist, in the same way that a twelve-year-old with an Xbox 360 and Minecraft considers himself to be a gamer. I am, in this same way, a philosopher.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have 3 siblings: a younger brother named Tucker (12), a younger adopted half-sister on my Mom's side named Bailey (14), and a baby half-brother on my Dad's side named Parker (6 months).
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy reading, writing, learning and studying languages, playing D&#38;D, and playing videogames. I love Star Wars, Harry Potter, and basically any other Sci-Fi/Fantasy book I've read or movie I've watched.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like math and science, and I am willing to tutor in those subjects (See <a href="hireme.html">Services</a>). I can also tutor is Spanish (3 and below) or Latin (1).
