        <h1 class="head2">Hire my Services</h1>
        <p>I can tutor in math (Algebra 2/IM3 and before), science (biology and basic chemistry), Spanish (3 and below), and Latin (1). I can also do translations in Spanish. I hope to have a system set up soon, but for now, <a href="contactme.html">contact me</a> to schedule my services. I do not always work for free, however. Most things, such as tutoring, are free, but only to an extent. I will also be more flexible in my schedule and time helping you fo higher prices. Contact me for details.</p>
